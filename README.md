# Functional Math Utils

This project demonstrates a functional programming approach to solving range-based mathematical problems using recursion and higher-order abstractions in TypeScript.

It highlights:

- **Recursive operations** â€“ like summing or multiplying numbers in a range, implemented without loops or mutation
- **Currying and function composition** â€“ turning multi-argument functions into flexible, reusable single-argument chains
- **Generic abstractions** â€“ using functions like `mapReduce` and `mapReduce2` to capture and reuse common recursive patterns
- **Composable utilities** â€“ building tools like `sumMap2` and `prodMap2` from a single, powerful abstraction
